Holographic Reduced Representations Playground
==============================================

Mostly to aid my understanding of using holographic
reduced representations.

Nothing special at the moment, but it may be useful
later.

Examples will be added shortly, for the meantime, you can view some
introductory information by running IPython notebook in this
directory, or by generating the documentation.

You are referred to (Plate 1991) and (Eliasmith 2013, Chapter 4)
for further details.
