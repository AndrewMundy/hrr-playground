Holographic Reduced Representations Playground
==============================================

Mostly to aid my understanding of using holographic
reduced representations.

Nothing special at the moment, but it may be useful
later.

`test.py` merely simulates setting up some vectors
in an _n_-dimensional space, creating a clean up
memory and performing various convolutions to
illustrate binding and unbinding of symbols.

You are referred to (Plate 1991) and (Eliasmith 2013, Chapter 4)
for further details.
